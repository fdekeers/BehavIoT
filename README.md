# BehavIoT
This repository is a fork of the code for the [IMC23 paper dubbed BehavIoT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3618257.3624829).
Paper BibTeX reference:

A Docker container image has been developed to ease the reproducibility of experiments.


## Docker container

Pull the image with:
```bash
docker pull fdekeers/behaviot
```

If you are a lone wolf, you can also build the image by yourself by yourself.
To do that, you will first need to download the tarball for Oracle JDK 7,
by taking a look at [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/be/java/technologies/javase/javase7-archive-downloads.html),
and put the tarball at this repository's root directory.
Then, execute the following command:
```bash
docker build [-t IMAGE_TAG] --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) .
```

Run a container instance with:
```bash
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/home/user/BehavIoT -it fdekeers/behaviot /home/user/BehavIoT/create_user.sh $(id -u) $(id -g)
```
(If you built the image by yourself, replace `fdekeers/behaviot` with the tag you gave to your image.)

# Testbed
The [device file](devices.txt) lists the smart home devices and their MAC address used in the paper.
For the testbed setup and software for traffic capture, please check out the [IMC19 paper](https://moniotrlab.khoury.northeastern.edu/publications/imc19/).
